The dashboard our team put together allows the user to view and interact with the data in order to better 
understand which liquors are sold the most, weather data including average temperature, rainfall, and snowfall, 
and how the latter can affect the former. Using this model, liquor stores can better predict when they should 
increase or decrease purchases of specific liquor.  By selecting your specific liquor in the Alcohol Type box, 
you can narrow your data down even more to allow you to make the best decisions for your customers.  You can change 
the temperature range, rainfall amount, and snowfall amounts as well to make the best predictions possible.
