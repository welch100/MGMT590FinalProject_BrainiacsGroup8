Project Summary (GitHub Readme): An elevator pitch for your topic (problem, evidence, recommendation)

Imagine harnessing the power of cloud computing to uncover hidden insights in a treasure trove of data. Our team is diving into the world of cloud computing using Google Cloud Platform to revolutionize the liquor retail industry. By analyzing a public BigQuery dataset containing years of wholesale liquor purchases in Iowa alongside archive (BigQuery public dataset) and real-time geospatial weather data, we're unearthing a connection between weather patterns and liquor sales.

The problem is simple: retailers often struggle to predict customer demand accurately, leading to stockouts or excess inventory. Our evidence lies in the comprehensive dataset that tracks every wholesale liquor transaction in the state since 2012. With the State of Iowa overseeing liquor distribution, this dataset offers unparalleled insights into consumer behavior.

Our recommendation? Leverage Cloud Functions, Cloud Pub/Sub, and BigQuery to process, integrate, and analyze this massive data. By correlating historical sales with weather fluctuations and seasonal trends, we can build predictive models that forecast liquor demand in real-time. This enables retailers to optimize inventory levels and marketing strategies, meeting customer needs precisely while reducing waste and optimizing their supply chain.

Based on the data and predictive modeling, we were able to determine the top types of liquor consumers purchased throughout the seasons, with vodka and whiskey standing out as year round best sellers. Our team identified a noticeable trend that during periods of snow and rain, demand does not decrease and people continued to purchase liquor, with some evidence of purchases increasing. Furthermore, we observed consumers purchase trends during weekdays vs. weekends and an overall increase of alcohol consumption since 2012.

But it doesn't stop there. We're integrating the OpenWeather API to stream live weather data, enabling our models to adapt to changing conditions in real time. This ensures that our predictions remain accurate and up-to-the-minute, which will enable retailers and distributors to accurately forecast their inventory to ensure that they can meet predicted demand and increase profits.

In a nutshell, our project brings together the past and the present, the data and the cloud, to transform liquor retailing into a finely-tuned, data-driven industry. With our insights, retailers can tap into the ebb and flow of consumer preferences like never before, ultimately raising profits and customer satisfaction to new heights.
